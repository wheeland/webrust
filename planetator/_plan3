to do:
    - replace simplification with something ROAM-like that doesn't add cuts in the
      middle of triangles -> can't have a vertex in the middle of nothing, this will blow up!
    x battle the screwups
    - add texturing, can choose shizzles from URL
        - save textures on server, reference via unique ID in the saved planets
    - gallery with some kewl planets
        - marz, urth, mewn
        - oasis -> dunes that shift along some vec2 noise direction (=wind direction),
          sprinkled water/forest oases
        - can click "new" on gallery -> create own planet, give name, save, publish to gallery
    - copy+paste
    - invisible overlay-button for loading shizzles
