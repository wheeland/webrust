approaches
    1. add water plane for every plate that has water
        - problem: water plane may lie under low-poly landmass, even for those
          areas where tex_heights < water_level
    2. raise vertices to at least water_level
        - problem: can't look underwater, can't dive (or needs special handling)
        - problem: when looking from sideways, water may be "above sea level"
          because the texture says "water" but the low-poly landmass is actually above
    3. do it all in the postprocessing-shader
        - same problem as above with low-poly landmasses 

solution for 2./3.: 
    when looking at a sharp angle, ignore "water upon land" gradually, depending
    on landmass normal and looking angle
