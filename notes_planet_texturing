    - 1st idea
        - go from the un-stretched cube, where every of the 6 faces can be NxN squares
        - now we can choose a random orientation of the texture for each square, and blend them at the sides
        - on top of this, we can do http://www.decarpentier.nl/scape-render
    - 2nd idea
        - we can define 6 or 12 or 24 or what different directions
        - each of these directions has an associated UV-space
        - each face chooses one main direction of how to orient
        - but actually it chooses a bunch, so as to make it smooth, and blend between them
