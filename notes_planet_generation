voronoi-noise by using the cell-noise, but filtering out N% of the candidates,

thoughts about noise:
    - perlin noise has this inherent "blobby" characteristic, everything is round and shit
    - we can un-blob perlin noise by either transforming the input coords, OR by
      adding a 4th, noised parameter (https://thingonitsown.blogspot.com/2019/01/general-domain-warping.html)
